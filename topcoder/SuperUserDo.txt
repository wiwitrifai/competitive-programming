PROBLEM STATEMENT
Fox Ciel just used the command "sudo" (super-user do) to gain administrative privileges in the UNIX-based operating system on her computer.
She now wants to install several new programs.
Each program has some dependencies: in addition to the program, the package manager has to install some libraries used by the program.

The package repository contains exactly 1000 libraries.
For simplicity, we will number them from 1 to 1000, inclusive.

You are given the information about the dependencies of the programs Fox Ciel wants to install.
More precisely, you are given the vector <int>s A and B, both containing the same number of elements.
For each valid i, one of the programs needs all libraries that have numbers between A[i] and B[i], inclusive.
Note that the programs may have overlapping dependences: multiple programs may require the same library to be installed.
Of course, in such cases it is sufficient to install such a library once.

Calculate and return the total number of libraries that need to be installed.

DEFINITION
Class:SuperUserDo
Method:install
Parameters:vector <int>, vector <int>
Returns:int
Method signature:int install(vector <int> A, vector <int> B)


CONSTRAINTS
-A will contain between 1 and 100 elements inclusive.
-B will contain the same number of elements as A.
-Each element of A will be between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
-The i-th element of B will be between A[i] and 1000 inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{1}
{10}

Returns: 10

Only libraries 1 to 10 must be installed, so the answer is 10.

1)
{1,101}
{10,110}

Returns: 20



2)
{1}
{1000}

Returns: 1000



3)
{1,2,3,4,5}
{6,7,8,9,10}

Returns: 10

In this test case the dependencies have non-empty intersections.
One program needs libraries from 1 to 6, another program needs libraries from 2 to 7, and so on.
In order to satisfy all dependencies, the package manager will install libraries numbered from 1 to 10, inclusive.
Hence, the total number of installed libraries is 10.

4)
{1,1}
{1,1}

Returns: 1
